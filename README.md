# Smart Recycling using Deep Learning

In this project, we have implemented "Smart Recycling" using Deep Learning where we have used Data augmentation & CNN - VGG16 Architecture using Transfer Learning & checked the dynamics of model performance (e.g., classification accuracy on the test data) while identifying model's strength and weakness. Furthermore, improved the model generalisability across domains using Resnet50 Architecture & built a workable prototype for our image classification as a web application.
